## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Robin Punnoose**. I'm a _freelance_ **_full-stack_** **Web** and **Blockchain**
 _developer_. I'm currently building web2 and
web3 projects. I mainly use React/Vite with vanilla CSS or Tailwind for the frontend. Nodejs has been my go to for the backend, but I have been learning Nest.js as well as looking into other options such as Django and .NET frameworks. I've learned blockchain development for EVM chains with Solidity. I'm spending my free time learning pixel art with Libresprite and game development with C#/Unity.
